I once set fire to one of Mrs Rossiter's ovens, I was making apple turnovers and the baking paper was too close to the flame. Luckily it burned out pretty quick, and the apple turnovers were quite nice.

Coincidentally, about five minutes after this event, someone set off the fire alarm, and that's how I gained my reputation as an arsonist.
