My computer science teacher has an obsession with aardvarks and they are also the first animal in the alphabet, so it felt fitting to include one somewhere.

It apparently took a fair bit of effort to work out how many moles of carbon are in an aardvark, I got magnus to do the maths because I'm pretty awful at chemistry.
