My computer science teacher has an obsession with aardvarks and they are also the first animal in the alphabet, so it felt fitting to include one somewhere.

It apparently took a fair bit of effort to work out how many moles of carbon are in an aardvark, I did not do it myself as my chemistry abilities are questionable at best.
