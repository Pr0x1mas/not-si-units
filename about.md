## Where it came from
The question was simple: why do we have to use SI units? What's to stop us using our own units?

My original idea was to break into France and pull the ol' switcheroo Indiana Jones style, and replace the kilogram with a pigeon (preferably not live as that could get messy). Sadly this was not an option, so I resorted to plan B: create my own system of units instead. With the help of various friends, I created alternative names and values for every base SI unit, as well as renaming [all other named units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientific_units_named_after_people#SI_derived_unit) with inside jokes and names of some people who helped.

## How it works
Each base unit has a ratio which shows how it can be converted from SI, e.g Uncomfortable Pause, a unit of time, has a ratio of 1:8.2, meaning 1 uncomfortable pause is 8.2 seconds. All other unit's conversion ratios are then derived from these ratios and base units.

## Why the name?
Nacia Netradicia is Esperanto for "national unconventional", intended to be the exact opposite of the translation of SI: "international standard".
